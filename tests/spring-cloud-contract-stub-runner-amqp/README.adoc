=== Stub Runner Spring AMQP

Spring Cloud Contract Verifier Stub Runner's messaging module provides an easy way to integrate with Spring AMQP's Rabbit Template.
For the provided artifacts it will automatically download the stubs and register the required
routes.

The integration tries to work standalone, that is without interaction with a running RabbitMQ message broker. It expects a `RabbitTemplate` on the application context and uses it as a spring boot test `@SpyBean`.
Thus it can use the mockito spy functionality to verify and introspect messages sent by the application.

IMPORTANT: In the current status of the implementation tries to find a `MessageListenerAdapter` on the application context to send messages into the application, because we want to avoid interacting with a running bus.
Using annotation driven listener endpoints (e.g. `@RabbitListener` annotated listener methods) is currently not supported.

==== Adding it to the project

It's enough to have both Spring AMQP and Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner on classpath.
Remember to annotate your test class with `@AutoConfigureMessageVerifier`.

==== Examples

===== Stubs structure

Let us assume that we have the following Maven repository with a deployed stubs for the
`spring-cloud-contract-amqp-test` application.

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
└── .m2
    └── repository
        └── com
            └── example
                └── spring-cloud-contract-amqp-test
                    ├── 0.4.0-SNAPSHOT
                    │   ├── spring-cloud-contract-amqp-test-0.4.0-SNAPSHOT.pom
                    │   ├── spring-cloud-contract-amqp-test-0.4.0-SNAPSHOT-stubs.jar
                    │   └── maven-metadata-local.xml
                    └── maven-metadata-local.xml
----

And the stubs contain the following structure:

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
├── META-INF
│   └── MANIFEST.MF
└── contracts
    └── shouldProduceValidPersonData.groovy
----

Let's consider the following contract:

[source,groovy]
----
include::src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/stubrunner/messaging/amqp/AmqpStubRunnerSpec.groovy[tags=amqp_contract,indent=0]
----


and the following Spring configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
include::src/test/resources/application.yml[]
----

===== Triggering the message

So to trigger a message using the contract above we'll use the `StubTrigger` interface as follows.

[source,groovy]
----
include::src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/stubrunner/messaging/amqp/AmqpStubRunnerSpec.groovy[tags=client_trigger,indent=0]
----

===== Spring AMQP Test Configuration

In order to avoid that Spring AMQP is trying to connect to a running broker during our tests we configure a mock `ConnectionFactory`.

To disable the mocked ConnectionFactory set the property `verifier.amqp.mockConnection=false`

[source,yaml]
----
verifier:
  amqp:
    mockConnection: false
----
