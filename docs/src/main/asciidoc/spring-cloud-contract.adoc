== Spring Cloud Contract

What you always need is confidence in pushing new features into a new application or service in a distributed system.
This project provides support for Consumer Driven Contracts and service schemas in Spring applications, covering a
range of options for writing tests, publishing them as assets, asserting that a contract is kept by producers
and consumers, for HTTP and message-based interactions.
