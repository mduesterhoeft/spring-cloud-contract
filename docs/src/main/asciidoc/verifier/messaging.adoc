=== Spring Cloud Contract Verifier Messaging

Spring Cloud Contract Verifier allows you to verify your application that uses messaging as means of communication.
All of our integrations are working with Spring but you can also create one yourself and use it.

==== Integrations

You can use one of the four integration configurations:

- Apache Camel
- Spring Integration
- Spring Cloud Stream
- Spring AMQP

Since we're using Spring Boot then if you have added one of the aforementioned libraries
to the classpath then automatically all the messaging configuration will be set up.

IMPORTANT: Remember to put `@AutoConfigureMessageVerifier` on the base class of your
generated tests. Otherwise messaging part of Spring Cloud Contract Verifier will not work.

==== Manual Integration Testing

The main interface used by the tests is the `org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.messaging.MessageVerifier`.
It defines how to send and receive messages. You can create your own implementation to achieve the
same goal.

In the a test you can inject a `ContractVerifierMessageExchange` to send and receive messages that follow the contract.
Then add `@AutoConfigureMessageVerifier` to your test, e.g.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@RunWith(SpringTestRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureMessageVerifier
public static class MessagingContractTests {

  @Autowired
  private MessageVerifier verifier;
  ...
}
----

NOTE: If your tests require stubs as well, then
`@AutoConfigureStubRunner` includes the messaging configuration, so
you only need the one annotation.

==== Publisher side test generation

Having the `input` or `outputMessage` sections in your DSL will result in creation of tests on the publisher's side. By default
JUnit tests will be created, however there is also a possibility to create Spock tests.

There are 3 main scenarios that we should take into consideration:

- Scenario 1: there is no input message that produces an output one. The output message is triggered by a component
inside the application (e.g. scheduler)
- Scenario 2: the input message triggers an output message
- Scenario 3: the input message is consumed and there is no output message

===== Scenario 1 (no input message)

For the given contract:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{verifier_core_path}/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/builder/MessagingMethodBodyBuilderSpec.groovy[tags=trigger_method_dsl]
----

The following JUnit test will be created:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{verifier_core_path}/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/builder/MessagingMethodBodyBuilderSpec.groovy[tags=trigger_method_junit_test]
----

And the following Spock test would be created:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{verifier_core_path}/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/builder/MessagingMethodBodyBuilderSpec.groovy[tags=trigger_method_test]
----

===== Scenario 2 (output triggered by input)

For the given contract:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{verifier_core_path}/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/builder/MessagingMethodBodyBuilderSpec.groovy[tags=trigger_message_dsl]
----

The following JUnit test will be created:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{verifier_core_path}/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/builder/MessagingMethodBodyBuilderSpec.groovy[tags=trigger_message_junit]
----

And the following Spock test would be created:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{verifier_core_path}/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/builder/MessagingMethodBodyBuilderSpec.groovy[tags=trigger_message_spock]
----

===== Scenario 3 (no output message)

For the given contract:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{verifier_core_path}/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/builder/MessagingMethodBodyBuilderSpec.groovy[tags=trigger_no_output_dsl]
----

The following JUnit test will be created:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{verifier_core_path}/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/builder/MessagingMethodBodyBuilderSpec.groovy[tags=trigger_no_output_junit]
----

And the following Spock test would be created:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{verifier_core_path}/src/test/groovy/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/builder/MessagingMethodBodyBuilderSpec.groovy[tags=trigger_no_output_spock]
----

==== Consumer Stub Side generation

Unlike the HTTP part - in Messaging we need to publish the Groovy DSL inside the JAR with a stub. Then it's parsed on the consumer side
and proper stubbed routes are created.

For more information please consult the Stub Runner Messaging sections.

===== Gradle Setup

Example of Spring Cloud Contract Verifier Gradle setup:

[source,groovy,indent=0]
----
include::{plugins_path}/spring-cloud-contract-gradle-plugin/src/test/resources/functionalTest/scenarioProject/build.gradle[tags=jar_setup,indent=0]
----

===== Maven Setup

Example of Maven can be found in the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/tree/master/samples/standalone/messaging/stream-sink/pom.xml[Stream Sink sample]
